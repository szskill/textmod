TextMod is a Discord bot for _modifying text_.

Not to be confused with _moderating_ text though.

To get started, simply use one of the Slash Commands:tm:, e.g.:

```sh
/reverse hello world
# textmod should respond with "dlrow olleh"
```

The rest of the commands can be found in the Slash Commands:tm: menu.
